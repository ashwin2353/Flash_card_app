French flashcard app: Learn common words; ✔ if known, ✘ if not. Reveals English after 3s. Unknown words auto-saved in CSV.

This flashcard app is meticulously crafted to facilitate the acquisition of French vocabulary, focusing on the most frequently used words in the French language. The learning process is straightforward: if you recognize a French word, simply click '✔'; conversely, if you're unfamiliar with it, click '✘.' After a concise three-second interval, the app swiftly unveils the English translation. What sets this app apart is its ability to automatically compile a separate CSV file containing all the French words you've indicated as unfamiliar (marked with '✘') for your future reference and review.
